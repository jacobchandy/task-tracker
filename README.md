# Task Tracker - To-Do List App

This is a Task Tracker or To-Do List App built with React and a local JSON server.

## Overview

This application allows you to track your tasks and to-do items efficiently. It is created using React for the front-end and a local JSON server to simulate a back-end for data storage.

## Important Note

Please be aware that this app does not store tasks on a hosted website. Instead, it relies on a local JSON server for data storage and management. Consequently, tasks are stored and managed locally on your system when you run the app. While this means that your tasks won't be accessible from other devices or locations, it works seamlessly on your local machine.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the application using `npm start`.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can add, edit, and delete tasks as needed. The app provides a simple and user-friendly interface for managing your tasks.
